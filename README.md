# Twine tool

## JSwine

JSwine is a converter which can turn an exported JSON file from [Twine 2](http://twinery.org/2) which is usually included as a resource in visual novel like games, back into its native project. So you can overview the whole route and even, if you want, edit the route and exported it back as a resource.

Basically, it reverses what [Twison](https://github.com/lazerwalker/twison) did.
